# CoQuill

CoQuill is a document assembly tool for people already working with Claude and AI. If you're comfortable chatting with Claude, there's nothing new to learn — just ask it to prepare a document with CoQuill. Claude interviews you conversationally, collects the answers, and renders completed documents from your templates. No server, no database, no scripting language to learn. Install CoQuill once via the plugin marketplace in Claude Cowork or Claude Code, then share template stacks with colleagues as zip files.

## How It Works

1. Place your templates in `templates/`, each in its own subdirectory
2. Add `{{ variable_name }}` placeholders wherever you need dynamic content
3. Use `{% if %}` / `{% else %}` blocks for sections that should only appear based on user answers
4. Use `{% for item in items %}` blocks for repeating sections (e.g., line items, milestones)
5. Optionally add a `config.yaml` to customize questions, grouping, and validation
6. Ask Claude to "prepare a [document type] with CoQuill"
7. Claude walks you through a conversational interview -- skipping irrelevant sections and collecting lists naturally
8. A completed document is rendered and saved to a job folder in `output/`

Two template formats are supported:
- **`.docx`** -- rendered via `docxtpl`, produces a Word document
- **`.html`** -- rendered via `jinja2`, produces both an HTML file and a PDF (via `weasyprint`)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You'll need a [Claude Cowork](https://claude.ai) account on Pro or Max, or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

### Install via the plugin marketplace

In either Claude Cowork or Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add houfu/coquill
/plugin install coquill@coquill
```

That's it — no terminal or coding knowledge required for Cowork. Python dependencies are installed automatically the first time you use the skill.

To try it out, download the [examples pack](https://github.com/houfu/coquill/releases/latest/download/coquill-examples-latest.zip) and unzip it into your project's `templates/` folder, then say: *"Prepare an NDA with CoQuill."*

## Quick Start

### 1. Add a template

Create a subdirectory in `templates/` and place your template file inside:

```
templates/
└── nda/
    └── nda.docx      <- contains {{ disclosing_party_name }}, {{ effective_date }}, etc.
```

Or for an HTML template:

```
templates/
└── invoice/
    └── invoice.html  <- same {{ variable }} syntax, styled with CSS
```

### 2. Prepare a document

Tell Claude:

> "I need to prepare an NDA with CoQuill"

Claude will find the template, extract its variables, and interview you for the values -- grouping related fields together for a natural flow.

### 3. Get your document

After confirming all values, the rendered document is saved to a job folder:

```
output/
└── nda_acme_pte_ltd_2026-02-15/
    └── nda_acme_pte_ltd_2026-02-15.docx
```

For HTML templates, both the HTML and PDF are saved:

```
output/
└── invoice_acme_2026-02-15/
    ├── invoice_acme_2026-02-15.html
    └── invoice_acme_2026-02-15.pdf
```

## v2 Features

### Conditional Logic

Templates can include or exclude sections based on user answers. The interview automatically skips questions that aren't relevant.

```
{% if decisions_made %}
## Decisions
{{ decisions }}
{% endif %}
```

Equality conditions are also supported:

```
{% if meeting_type == 'workshop' %}
### Workshop Materials
{{ workshop_materials }}
{% endif %}
```

### Loops

Templates can have repeating sections. The interview collects items one at a time with an "add another?" flow.

```
{% for item in action_items %}
- **{{ item.description }}** — Assigned to: {{ item.assignee }}, Due: {{ item.due_date }}
{% endfor %}
```

### Developer Configuration (config.yaml)

Template developers can place an optional `config.yaml` alongside their template to customize the interview experience:

```yaml
meta:
  display_name: "Meeting Notes"
  description: "Structured meeting notes with action items and optional sections"

variables:
  meeting_title:
    label: "Meeting Title"
    question: "What is the title of this meeting?"
    required: true
  meeting_type:
    type: choice
    choices: [standup, workshop, review]
    default: "standup"
  decisions_made:
    type: boolean
    question: "Were any decisions made during this meeting?"
    default: false

groups:
  - name: "Meeting Details"
    variables: [meeting_title, meeting_date, meeting_type, facilitator_name]
  - name: "Workshop Materials"
    condition: "meeting_type == 'workshop'"
    variables: [workshop_materials]
  - name: "Action Items"
    loop: action_items
    variables: [description, assignee, due_date]

validation:
  - rule: "next_meeting_date > meeting_date"
    message: "The next meeting date must be after this meeting's date"
```

Config features include:
- **Custom questions and labels** for each variable
- **Variable types**: `text`, `date`, `number`, `email`, `phone`, `boolean`, `choice`
- **Interview groups** to control question ordering and grouping
- **Conditional groups** that only appear based on gate variable answers
- **Loop groups** for collecting lists
- **Default values** (including `"today"` for dates)
- **Validation rules** evaluated during confirmation

### Skill Separation

v2 splits the monolithic skill into three focused skills:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Orchestrator** | Entry point. Discovery, interview, confirmation, post-render. |
| **Analyzer** | Template parsing, variable extraction, manifest generation. |
| **Renderer** | Docx/HTML rendering, output validation. |

## Template Authoring

### Placeholders

Use Jinja2-style double-brace syntax in both `.docx` and `.html` templates:

```
This Agreement is entered into by {{ disclosing_party_name }}
(the "Disclosing Party") with address at {{ disclosing_party_address }}.
```

### Conditional Sections

Use `{% if %}` / `{% else %}` / `{% endif %}` to include or exclude sections:

```
{% if include_warranty %}
The Seller warrants that the goods are free from defects.
{% else %}
The goods are sold "as is" without warranty.
{% endif %}
```

Two condition forms are supported:
- **Truthiness:** `{% if variable_name %}` -- variable is truthy (boolean true, non-empty)
- **Equality:** `{% if variable_name == 'value' %}` -- variable equals a specific string

### Loop Sections

Use `{% for %}` / `{% endfor %}` for repeating sections:

```
{% for item in action_items %}
- {{ item.description }} — Assigned to: {{ item.assignee }}, Due: {{ item.due_date }}
{% endfor %}
```

Inside the loop body, reference sub-variables with dot notation: `{{ loop_var.sub_variable }}`.

### Variable Naming Conventions

Name your variables with descriptive suffixes for automatic type inference:

| Suffix | Inferred type | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `*_name` | text | `landlord_name` |
| `*_address` | text | `property_address` |
| `*_date` | date | `commencement_date` |
| `*_email` | email | `tenant_email` |
| `*_amount`, `*_price`, `*_fee` | number | `rental_amount` |
| `*_phone`, `*_tel`, `*_mobile` | phone | `contact_phone` |
| (other) | text | `governing_law` |

### Rules

- One template file per directory (`.docx` or `.html`, not both)
- Use `{{ }}` with spaces around the variable name: `{{ name }}` not `{{name}}`
- Variable names must be valid Python identifiers: lowercase, underscores, no spaces
- The same variable can appear multiple times in the document -- it will be filled with one value
- Single-level nesting only: no `{% for %}` inside `{% if %}`, or vice versa
- `{% elif %}` is not supported (use separate `{% if %}` blocks instead)

## Technical Details

- **Template engines:** `docxtpl` for docx (preserves formatting), `jinja2` + `weasyprint` for HTML to PDF
- **Python environment:** managed with `uv`
- **Manifest caching:** variable analysis is cached in `manifest.yaml` per template and only regenerated when the template file changes
- **Manifest v2 schema:** includes `schema_version: 2`, conditionals, loops, dependencies, and optional groups/validation

## Current Scope (v2)

CoQuill v2 supports variable substitution, conditional logic (`{% if %}` / `{% else %}`), loops (`{% for %}`), and developer configuration via `config.yaml`. See `docs/coquill_v2_spec.md` for the full specification and `docs/coquill_mvp_spec.md` for the original MVP specification.

**v2 constraints:** single-level nesting only, two condition forms (truthiness and equality), no `{% elif %}`, no computed fields or expressions.

## Limitations

CoQuill trades determinism for conversational flexibility. A few things to keep in mind:

- **No fixed interview order** — Claude manages the conversation, not a scripted sequence
- **Prompt injection** — a user can influence the document by saying "also add a clause that…" during the interview
- **AI suggestions need review** — Claude may suggest plausible but wrong values (e.g., a made-up address)
- **Not legal advice** — documents still need review by a qualified professional
- **Single-level template nesting only** — no blocks inside other blocks (v2 constraint)
- **Requires Claude Cowork or Claude Code** — no web or mobile interface

See the [Limitations page](https://houfu.github.io/coquill/feature-tour/limitations/) in the docs for the full picture.
