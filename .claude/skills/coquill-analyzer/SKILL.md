# CoQuill — Template Analyzer v2

You are running the CoQuill template analyzer. You receive a **template directory path** from the Orchestrator (e.g., `templates/_examples/Bonterms_Mutual_NDA/`).

## Step 1 — Resolve Script Path and Run

```python
import os
script = os.path.join(
    os.environ.get("CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT", ""),
    "scripts", "analyze.py"
)
```

If `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set, the path resolves to `scripts/analyze.py` relative to the project root.

Run the script:

```bash
python <script_path> <template_dir> [--force]
```

Pass `--force` if the Orchestrator requests re-analysis (skips the cache check).

The script handles: format detection, caching, text extraction (including docx XML merge), two-pass analysis, type inference, condition parsing, loop sub-variable extraction, dependency graph construction, config.yaml merge, and manifest save.

### Interpret Script Output

- **Exit 0** with `"Manifest is up to date"` — cached manifest is valid; load it from `<template_dir>/manifest.yaml`.
- **Exit 0** with `"Manifest written"` — fresh analysis complete; proceed to Step 2.
- **Exit 1** — error (e.g., no template file found, corrupt docx). Report the stderr/stdout message to the Orchestrator.

## Step 2 — Validate the Manifest

After a fresh analysis (not a cache hit), load `manifest.yaml` and check for issues the script cannot catch:

1. **Zero variables** — if `variable_count` is 0, the template has no placeholders. Warn the Orchestrator; it may be the wrong file.
2. **Orphaned gate variables** — every variable listed in `dependencies` keys must appear in `variables`. If one is missing, the interview will fail to collect the gate value.
3. **Conditional variables shadowing unconditional** — if the same variable name appears in both `variables` and a conditional's `if_variables`/`else_variables`, flag it. The script deduplicates these, but a config.yaml merge could reintroduce duplicates.
4. **Loop sub-variables with no names** — if a loop's `variables` list is empty, the loop collects nothing. This may be intentional (iteration-only) or a sign the template uses a non-standard loop variable pattern.
5. **Config.yaml drift** — if `config.yaml` exists, quickly scan it for variable names that don't appear anywhere in the manifest. These are config entries for variables the template no longer uses. Warn so the developer can clean up.
6. **Sanitize/lint warnings** — if `manifest.warnings` is present and non-empty, surface each entry to the Orchestrator. These are author-actionable issues the script auto-corrected during analysis: smart quotes inside tag bodies (Word autocorrect), unrecognized docxtpl prefixes (`{%p`/`{%tr`/`{%tc`) that were stripped for analysis only, and undefined Jinja callables that will fail at render time. Each warning is a string formatted as `"<code>: <detail>"` (codes: `smart_quote`, `docxtpl_prefix`, `undefined_callable`).

Report any warnings alongside the manifest contents when returning to the Orchestrator.

### Lint-only mode

If the Orchestrator wants warnings without writing a manifest, invoke:

```bash
python <script_path> <template_dir> --lint
```

This runs extract → sanitize → callable-detect, prints warnings to stdout, and exits non-zero if any are found. No `manifest.yaml` is written.

## Step 3 — Return to Orchestrator

Return the full `manifest.yaml` contents to the Orchestrator, along with any warnings from Step 2.
